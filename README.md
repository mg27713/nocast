Protects against screen-monitoring software. Chrome OS only, anything else will probably destroy your eyes.

## Usage
Simply set your Chromebook to "Night Light" mode, and set the color temperature to the highest setting. You can now safely open https://mg27713.github.io/nocast/ without hurting your eyes.

The flashing colors can also be put on some normal websites by adding the website-specific script in the `websites` folder to the website, using your JS editing extension of choice.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible if you destroy your eyes as a result of improper usage of this app. Everything has been tested in 2021, things might be different in 2031.
